# IMGDesk
 IMG Desk - A program to manage the IMG file format for 4 games. III, VC, SA and IV. (GTA Games)
 
 This project was experimental to learn the basics of the Rust language.
 
 This project is yet to be updated to:
 - Avoid cloning stuff in several places.
 - Use traits/inheritance better.

The IMG tool is very basic, but does support undo and redo for all actions.
